GitHub Pages + Jekyll = [:)]
================
>####Learn how GitHub and Jekyll works and how they can help you make static websites without database and easier to manage.

What are GitHub Pages?
----------------
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through our site. User, Organization, and Project Pages. There are two basic types of GitHub Pages: User/Organization Pages and Project Pages. They are nearly identical, but there are a few important differences between them.

- User & Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files. You will need to name this repository with the account name.

- Unlike User and Organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same repository as their project. Both personal accounts and organizations can create Project Pages.

####Free hosting with GitHub Pages. 
Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free—custom domain name and all.

What is Jekyll?
----------------

The Jekyll is a generator of static code. The idea is that you create pages and even a statically blog using HTML with a few tricks that will help you convert your website into static files, ready to be published.
It is based on various formats like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting to text and posts and a template pattern called Liquid with a bit of [YAML](yaml.org) to view and save the data of the variables.

Using Jekyll
----------------
Every GitHub Page runs through Jekyll when you push content to a specially named branch within your repository. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
