================
>Learn how GitHub and Jekyll works and how they can help you make static websites without database and easier to manage.

What are GitHub Pages?
----------------
>GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through our site. User, Organization, and Project Pages. There are two basic types of GitHub Pages: User/Organization Pages and Project Pages. They are nearly identical, but there are a few important differences between them.

> User & Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files. You will need to name this repository with the account name.

> Unlike User and Organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same repository as their project. Both personal accounts and organizations can create Project Pages.
